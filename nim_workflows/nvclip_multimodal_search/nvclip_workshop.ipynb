    "# NV-CLIP NIM Multimodal Search Workshop\n",
    "\n",
    "NVIDIA Inference Microservices (NIMs) are a collection of easy to use API driven microservices to interact with AI models.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop will focus on the NV-CLIP NIM which is a commerically viable embedding model for both images and text. Having both images and text in the same embedding space makes it easy to determine how similar text is to any given image. \n",
    "\n",
    "This capability of being able to associate images with text, has led to the development of a new class of open vocabulary models that allow you to detect or classify anything based on text descriptions and powerful search applications through natural language. This notebook will explore how the embeddings produced by NV-CLIP can be used to create a semantic search application over a traffic camera dataset. \n",

    "Part 1 showed how to use the NVCLIP API to convert image and text into an embedding. This embedding is a 1024 dimensional vector of floating point numbers. One of the main benefits of converting image and text into a vector with an embedding model, is it enables an easy way to determine how similar images and text are to each other by calculating the cosine similarity between the vectors.  NVCLIP was trained on millions of image text pairs, allowing it to learn the association betweeen text and images. This knowledge is then captured in the embeddings that NVCLIP generates allowing us to use it as a tool to determine similarity between text and images. \n",
